After finding out that it was Middle Child's Day on Aug 12<sup>th</sup>, my brother, who is the middle child, immediately demanded that a present because his day had passed. After a day of hanging out around downtown, my girlfriend and I are sitting around and I come up with an idea to mess with and pacify my brother. We decided that we'd make a little webpage devoted to the middle child. 

It turned out that my brother didn't think it was funny in the slightest but agreed that it was a "good" gift. My girlfriend and I soon after decided that we'd create a site in order to help promote middle child day. The site is [Happy Middle Child Day](http://happymiddlechildday.com/)
